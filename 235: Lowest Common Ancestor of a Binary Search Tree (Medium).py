# Q: why not TC is O(logn)
{
#    Short answer: we write the time as O(h) (where h = tree height) because thatâ€™s true for every BST.
#   If the BST is balanced then h = O(log n) and you can also say O(log n). But in the worst case a BST 
#  can be a straight chain (height h = n), so the only safe general bound is O(h) (which could be O(n) in the worst case).
